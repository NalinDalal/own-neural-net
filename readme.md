# Neural Network from Scratch
neurons have some input, their corresponding weights and then you add some bias to it
the output is:
```python
inputs = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 2.5 ]
weights = [[ 0.2 , 0.8 , -0.5 ,1],
[0.5,
- 0.91 , 0.26 ,
- 0.5 ],
[-0.26,- 0.27 , 0.17 , 0.87 ]]

biases = [ 2 , 3 , 0.5 ]
# Output of current layer
layer_outputs = []

# For each neuron
for neuron_weights, neuron_bias in zip (weights, biases):
    # Zeroed output of given neuron
    neuron_output = 0
    # For each input and weight to the neuron
    for n_input, weight in zip (inputs, neuron_weights):
        # Multiply this input by associated weight
        # and add to the neuron’s output variable
        neuron_output += n_input * weight
    # Add bias
    neuron_output += neuron_bias
    # Put neuron’s result to the layer’s output list
    layer_outputs.append(neuron_output)
print (layer_outputs)
```

then you can arrange multiple neurons on a sort of stack
so called neural network

fully connected neural network — every
neuron in the current layer has connections to every neuron from the previous layer

## Tensors, Arrays and Vectors
u know array, then you know about matrix, and 3d array
A tensor object is an object that can be represented as an array.

then u know about dot product of vector
```python
a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
b = [ 2 , 3 , 4 ]
dot_product = a[ 0 ] * b[ 0 ] + a[ 1 ] * b[ 1 ] + a[ 2 ] * b[ 2 ]
print (dot_product)
```

use numpy to calculate the dot product
```python
import numpy as np
inputs = [ 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 2.5 ]
weights = [ 0.2 , 0.8 ,- 0.5 , 1.0 ]
bias = 2.0
outputs = np.dot(weights, inputs) + bias
print (outputs)
```

Layer of Neuron with NumPy
```python
import numpy as np
inputs = [ 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 2.5 ]
weights = [[ 0.2 , 0.8 ,- 0.5 , 1 ],
[ 0.5 ,- 0.91 , 0.26 ,- 0.5 ],
[ - 0.26 ,- 0.27 , 0.17 , 0.87 ]]
biases = [ 2.0 , 3.0 , 0.5 ]
layer_outputs = np.dot(weights, inputs) + biases
print (layer_outputs)

#array([ 4.8 1.21 2.385 ])
```

then u know how to find matrix multiplication

## Adding Layers
2/more hidden layer complicate the network
say Input layer with 4 features into a hidden layer with 3 neurons.
```python
import numpy as np
inputs = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 2.5 ], [ 2.0 , 5.0 ,-1.0,2.0],[ - 1.5 , 2.7 , 3.3 , -0.8 ]]
weights = [[ 0.2 , 0.8 ,- 0.5 , 1 ],
[ 0.5 ,- 0.91 , 0.26 ,- 0.5 ],
[ - 0.26 ,- 0.27 , 0.17 , 0.87 ]]
biases = [ 2 , 3 , 0.5 ]
weights2 = [[ 0.1 ,- 0.14 , 0.5 ],
[ - 0.5 , 0.12 ,- 0.33 ],
[ - 0.44 , 0.73 ,- 0.13 ]]
biases2 = [ - 1 , 2 ,- 0.5 ]


layer1_outputs = np.dot(inputs, np.array(weights).T) + biases
layer2_outputs = np.dot(layer1_outputs, np.array(weights2).T) + biases2
print (layer2_outputs)
```
```
array([[ 0.5031 - 1.04185 - 2.03875 ],
[ 0.2434 - 2.7332 - 5.7633 ],
[ - 0.99314 1.41254 - 0.35655 ]])
```

creating a dataset, that is non-linear
```python
from nnfs.datasets import spiral_data
import numpy as np
import nnfs
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

nnfs.init() #sets the random seed to 0 (by the default), creates a float32 dtype default, and overrides the original dot product from NumPy

X, y = spiral_data( samples = 100 , classes = 3 )   #create a dataset with as many classes as we want.
plt.scatter(X[:, 0 ],X[:, 1 ])
plt.show()

#adding colour to chart
plt.scatter(X[:, 0 ], X[:, 1 ], c = y, cmap = 'brg' )
plt.show()
```

## Dense Layer Class
```python
class Layer_Dense :
    def __init__ ( self , n_inputs , n_neurons ):
        # Initialize weights and biases(randomly)
        self.weights = 0.01 * np.random.randn(n_inputs,n_neurons) 
        self.biases = np.zeros((1 , n_neurons))
        pass # using pass statement as a placeholder

    # Forward pass
    def forward ( self , inputs ):
        # Calculate output values from inputs, weights and biases
        pass # using pass statement as a placeholder

# Create dataset
X, y = spiral_data( samples = 100 , classes = 3 )

# Create Dense layer with 2 input features and 3 output values
dense1 = Layer_Dense( 2 , 3 )

# Perform a forward pass of our training data through this layer
dense1.forward(X)

# Let's see output of the first few samples:
print (dense1.output[: 5 ])
```

# Activation Functions
for a neural network to fit a nonlinear function, 
we need it to contain two or more hidden layers, and
we need those hidden layers to use a nonlinear activation function.

u connect neurons to justify the graphs

**ReLU**
relu: if current value is greater than 0 then set to 1, else to 0
```python
inputs = [ 0 , 2 ,- 1 , 3.3 ,- 2.7 , 1.1 , 2.2 ,- 100 ]

output = []
for i in inputs:
    if i > 0 :
        output.append(i)
    else :
    output.append(0)
print (output)
```

ReLU in this code is a loop where we’re checking if the
current value is greater than 0. If it is, we’re appending it to the output list, and if it’s not, we’re
appending 0. This can be written more simply, as we just need to take the largest of two values: 0
or neuron value

```python
inputs = [ 0 , 2 ,- 1 , 3.3 ,- 2.7 , 1.1 , 2.2 ,- 100 ]

output = []
for i in inputs:
    output.append(max(0,i))
print (output)
```

applying to our neural network:
```python
# ReLU activation
class Activation_ReLU :
    # Forward pass
    def forward ( self , inputs ):
        # Calculate output values from input
        self.output = np.maximum( 0 , inputs)

# Create dataset
X, y = spiral_data( samples = 100 , classes = 3 )

# Create Dense layer with 2 input features and 3 output values
dense1 = Layer_Dense( 2 , 3 )
# Create ReLU activation (to be used with Dense layer):
activation1 = Activation_ReLU()
    
# Make a forward pass of our training data through this layer
dense1.forward(X)
    
# Forward pass through activation func.
# Takes in output from previous layer
activation1.forward(dense1.output)

# Let's see output of the first few samples:
print (activation1.output[: 5 ])
```

**SoftMax Function:**
activation function meant for classification
function represents confidence scores for each class and will add up to 1.
For example, 
if our network has a confidence distribution for two classes: [0.45, 0.55] , 
the prediction is the 2nd class, but the confidence in this prediction isn’t very high. 
Maybe our program would not act in this case since it’s not very confident.

Here's the function for the **Softmax**:

$$
S_{i,j} = \frac{e^{z_{i,j}}}{\sum_{l=1}^{L} e^{z_{i,l}}}
$$

```python
# Values from the previous output when we described
# what a neural network is
layer_outputs = [ 4.8 , 1.21 , 2.385 ]
# e - mathematical constant, we use E here to match a common coding
# style where constants are uppercased
E = 2.71828182846 # you can also use math.e
# For each value in a vector, calculate the exponential value
exp_values = []
for output in layer_outputs:
    exp_values.append(E ** output) # ** - power operator in Python
print ( 'exponentiated values:' )
print (exp_values)

>>>
exponentiated values:
[ 121.51041751893969 , 3.3534846525504487 , 10.85906266492961 ]
```

exponential function is a monotonic function. This means that, with higher input values,
outputs are also higher, so we won’t change the predicted class after applying it while making
sure that we get non-negative values. It also adds stability to the result as the normalized
exponentiation is more about the difference between numbers than their magnitudes.

```python
# Now normalize values
norm_base = sum (exp_values) # We sum all values
norm_values = []
for value in exp_values:
    norm_values.append(value / norm_base)
print ( 'Normalized exponentiated values:' )
print (norm_values)

print ( 'Sum of normalized values:', sum (norm_values))
```

```
>>>
Normalized exponentiated values:
[ 0.8952826639573506 , 0.024708306782070668 , 0.08000902926057876 ]

# Calculating Network Error with Loss

find categorical cross entropy as a u know mean entropy or something


Where L i denotes sample loss value, i is the i-th sample in the set, j is the label/output index, y
denotes the target values, and y-hat denotes the predicted values

Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss:

$$
L_i = - \sum_j y_{i,j} \log(\hat{y}_{i,j})
$$

Where $L_i$ denotes sample loss value, $i$ is the i-th sample in the set, $j$ is the label/output index, $y$ denotes the target values, and $\hat{y}$ denotes the predicted values.

softmax output of [ 0.7 , 0.1 , 0.2 ] and targets of [ 1 , 0 , 0 ] , we can apply the
calculations as follows:
$$
L_i = - \sum_j y_{i,j} \log(\hat{y}_{i,j})
L_i= -(1*log(0.7)+0*log(0.1)+0*log(0.2))
    = -(-0.35667494393873245+0+0)
    = 0.35667494393873245
$$


```python
import math
# An example output from the output layer of the neural network
softmax_output = [ 0.7 , 0.1 , 0.2 ]

# Ground truth
target_output = [ 1 , 0 , 0 ]
loss = - (math.log(softmax_output[ 0 ])  * target_output[ 0 ]+
math.log(softmax_output[ 1 ]) * target_output[ 1 ] +
math.log(softmax_output[ 2 ]) * target_output[ 2 ] )

print (loss)
```

```
0.35667494393873245
```


## Accuracy Calculation
how often the largest confidence is the correct class
in terms of a fraction. 
use the argmax values from the softmax outputs and then compare
these to the targets

```python
import numpy as np
# Probabilities of 3 samples
softmax_outputs = np.array([[ 0.7 , 0.2 , 0.1 ],
[ 0.5 , 0.1 , 0.4 ],
[ 0.02 , 0.9 , 0.08 ]])

# Target (ground-truth) labels for 3 samples
class_targets = np.array([ 0 , 1 , 1 ])

# Calculate values along second axis (axis of index 1)
predictions = np.argmax(softmax_outputs, axis = 1 )
# If targets are one-hot encoded - convert them
if len (class_targets.shape) == 2 :
    class_targets = np.argmax(class_targets, axis = 1 )
# True evaluates to 1; False to 0
accuracy = np.mean(predictions == class_targets)

print ( 'acc1:', accuracy)

# Calculate accuracy from output of activation2 and targets
# calculate values along first axis
predictions = np.argmax(activation2.output, axis = 1 )
if len (y.shape) == 2 :
    y = np.argmax(y, axis = 1 )
accuracy2 = np.mean(predictions == y)

# Print accuracy
print ( 'acc2:' , accuracy2)
```

```
acc1: 0.6666666666666666
acc2: 0.34
```

# Optimisations
randomly changing the weights, checking the loss, and
repeating this until happy with the lowest loss found.
```python

# Create dataset
X, y = vertical_data( samples = 100 , classes = 3 )

# Create model
dense1 = Layer_Dense( 2 , 3 ) # first dense layer, 2 inputs
activation1 = Activation_ReLU()
dense2 = Layer_Dense( 3 , 3 ) # second dense layer, 3 inputs, 3 outputs
activation2 = Activation_Softmax()
# Create loss function
loss_function = Loss_CategoricalCrossentropy()

# Helper variables
lowest_loss = 9999999 # some initial value

best_dense1_weights = dense1.weights.copy()
best_dense1_biases = dense1.biases.copy()
best_dense2_weights = dense2.weights.copy()
best_dense2_biases = dense2.biases.copy()
```

iterate as many times as desired, pick random values for weights and biases, and
save the weights and biases if they generate the lowest-seen loss:

```python
for iteration in range ( 10000 ):
    # Generate a new set of weights for iteration
    dense1.weights = 0.05 * np.random.randn( 2 , 3 )
    dense1.biases = 0.05 * np.random.randn( 1 , 3 )
    dense2.weights = 0.05 * np.random.randn( 3 , 3 )
    dense2.biases = 0.05 * np.random.randn( 1 , 3 )
    
    # Perform a forward pass of the training data through this layer
    dense1.forward(X)
    activation1.forward(dense1.output)
    dense2.forward(activation1.output)
    activation2.forward(dense2.output)
    
    # Perform a forward pass through activation function
    # it takes the output of second dense layer here and returns loss
    loss = loss_function.calculate(activation2.output, y)

    # Calculate accuracy from output of activation2 and targets
    # calculate values along first axis
    predictions = np.argmax(activation2.output, axis = 1 )
    accuracy = np.mean(predictions == y)
    
    # If loss is smaller - print and save weights and biases aside
    if loss < lowest_loss:
        print ( 'New set of weights found, iteration:', iteration,
            'loss:', loss,'acc:', accuracy)
        best_dense1_weights = dense1.weights.copy()
        best_dense1_biases = dense1.biases.copy()
        best_dense2_weights = dense2.weights.copy()
        best_dense2_biases = dense2.biases.copy()
        lowest_loss = loss
```

# Derivatives

consider a simple function : 
y=f(x)
f(x)=2*x

plotting x v/s y graph:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
def f ( x ):
    return 2 * x

x = np.array( range ( 5 ))
y = f(x)
print (x)   #[ 0 1 2 3 4 ]
print (y)   #[ 0 2 4 6 8 ]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

slope: $\frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1}$

printing this slope:
```py
print ((y[ 1 ] - y[ 0 ]) / (x[ 1 ] - x[ 0 ]))
```

we can calulate similarly derivatives for other functions

**Numerical Derivative**
calculating the
slope of the tangent line using two infinitely close points
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
def f ( x ):
    return 2 * x ** 2
# np.arange(start, stop, step) to give us smoother line
x = np.arange( 0 , 5 , 0.001 )
y = f(x)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

hence you can plot various functions

**Derivatives**
U know how to find derivatives of functions

The derivative of a constant equals 0 (m is a constant in this case, as it’s not a parameter that we are deriving with respect to, which is x in this example):

$$
\frac{d}{dx} 1 = 0
$$

$$
\frac{d}{dx} m = 0
$$

The derivative of $x$ equals 1:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} x = 1
$$

The derivative of a linear function equals its slope:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} (mx + b) = m
$$

Rules:

The derivative of a constant multiple of the function equals the constant multiple of the function’s derivative:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} [k \cdot f(x)] = k \cdot \frac{d}{dx} f(x)
$$

The derivative of a sum of functions equals the sum of their derivatives:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) + g(x)] = \frac{d}{dx} f(x) + \frac{d}{dx} g(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)
$$

The same concept applies to subtraction:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) - g(x)] = \frac{d}{dx} f(x) - \frac{d}{dx} g(x) = f'(x) - g'(x)
$$

The derivative of an exponentiation:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^n = n \cdot x^{n-1}
$$

# Gradients, Partial Derivatives, and the Chain Rule

**Gradient:**
- The gradient is a vector of partial derivatives. It points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of a function.
- For a function $f(x, y)$, the gradient is:
  $$
  \nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right)
  $$

**Partial Derivative:**
- A partial derivative measures how a function changes as only one variable changes, keeping others constant.
- For $f(x, y)$:
  $$
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
  $$

**Chain Rule:**
- The chain rule is used to compute the derivative of composite functions.
- If $y = f(g(x))$, then:
  $$
  \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{df}{dg} \cdot \frac{dg}{dx}
  $$
- For multivariable functions:
  $$
  \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}
  $$

**Example:**
If $z = f(y)$ and $y = g(x)$, then:
$$
\frac{dz}{dx} = \frac{dz}{dy} \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}
$$

$$

# Optimisers


### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Stochastic Gradient Descent updates the model parameters using the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters. It uses a small batch of data (or a single data point) to compute the gradient, making it computationally efficient but noisy.

**Function:**
```python
# SGD update rule
w = w - learning_rate * gradient
```

### Learning Rate
The learning rate controls the step size during the parameter update. A high learning rate may overshoot the optimal solution, while a low learning rate may result in slow convergence.

### Learning Rate Decay
Learning rate decay reduces the learning rate over time to ensure convergence. This helps the model settle into a minimum by taking smaller steps as training progresses.

**Function:**
```python
# Learning rate decay
learning_rate = initial_lr / (1 + decay_rate * epoch)
```

### Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum
Momentum accelerates SGD by adding a fraction of the previous update to the current update. This helps navigate ravines and reduces oscillations.

**Function:**
```python
# SGD with Momentum
velocity = momentum * velocity - learning_rate * gradient
w = w + velocity
```

### AdaGrad
AdaGrad adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradients. It performs well for sparse data but may lead to vanishing learning rates.

**Function:**
```python
# AdaGrad update rule
g = gradient
cache += g**2
w = w - (learning_rate / (sqrt(cache) + epsilon)) * g
```

### RMSProp
RMSProp modifies AdaGrad by introducing a decay factor to the historical gradients, preventing the learning rate from vanishing.

**Function:**
```python
# RMSProp update rule
g = gradient
cache = decay_rate * cache + (1 - decay_rate) * g**2
w = w - (learning_rate / (sqrt(cache) + epsilon)) * g
```

### Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)
Adam combines the benefits of Momentum and RMSProp. It maintains running averages of both the gradients and their squared values, making it robust and efficient.

**Function:**
```python
# Adam update rule
m = beta1 * m + (1 - beta1) * gradient
v = beta2 * v + (1 - beta2) * gradient**2
m_hat = m / (1 - beta1**t)
v_hat = v / (1 - beta2**t)
w = w - (learning_rate / (sqrt(v_hat) + epsilon)) * m_hat
```

# L1 Regularisation

L1 regularization adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the weights to the loss function. This encourages sparsity in the model by driving some weights to zero.

**Loss Function with L1 Regularization:**
```python
loss = original_loss + lambda_ * sum(abs(w))
```

## Backward Pass for L1 Regularization
During the backward pass, the gradient of the L1 penalty is added to the gradient of the loss function. The gradient of the L1 term is the sign of the weights.

**Backward Pass Implementation:**
```python
gradient += lambda_ * np.sign(w)
```

### Dropout

Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. During training, it randomly sets a fraction of the neurons' outputs to zero, effectively removing them from the network for that iteration. This forces the network to learn more robust features.

**Implementation:**
```python
# Dropout during training
mask = (np.random.rand(*layer_output.shape) > dropout_rate)
layer_output *= mask
layer_output /= (1 - dropout_rate)  # Scale to maintain expected value
```
